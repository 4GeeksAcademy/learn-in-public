# Teacher's responsibilities on this project

This project is called **Learn in Public** because the academy believes that learning in public is the most effective way to get a job.

> ðŸ‘‰ Learning in public is better than having a portfolio.

In an effort to apply the [Learn In Public methodology](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/), this project asks the students for the first time to create a pull request.

We have a bot that reviews that the pull requests are in good shape, but GitHub has blocked this bot from running for first time contributors.

That is why the bot is not able to approve and merge the students' PR's and you as a teacher will have to take a small action.

## What do you have to do?

Simple: 
1. Make sure you [have been added to the teachers team](https://github.com/orgs/4GeeksAcademy/teams/teachers/members) in order to have maintainer privileges.
2. Open the [list of PR's](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/About-4Geeks-Academy/pulls) and review the ones from your students, allow the bot to run by clicking on:

3. Make sure the bot takes over, runs the tests and the tests are approved and the PR is merged.

## But what if the automatic tests fail?

Teach the student how to review the test errors, fix them and submit for approval again. The second time, the bot will be able to run without approval.
